# Methods
* Docker to have things set up
* Manually time, or use simple timer program
* Test correct fix: write an unbugged function / write test cases
* Prevent user from accessing Rosetta Code
* Languages: Rust, Ruby, Go

# Materials
* Docker
* Compilers for Rust, Ruby, Swift
* Zoom

# Observations

# Conclusions

# Threats to Validity

## Automating tracking of time
* Program

## Parts not automated
* Proctoring
* Teaching Docker
* Timer stop when debugged

## Controlling for background experience
* Survey
  * ask how familiar
  * add in 10 extra languages for unbiased result
* If they know all 3 - either kick them out or make a note of it in results
